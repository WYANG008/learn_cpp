# -module option tells Libtool you want to call your library
# hithere, and not libhithere. The GNU Libtool Manual makes the statement that
# modules do not need to be prefixed with lib.
# using the Libtool -avoid-version option. This option
# causes Libtool to generate a shared library whose name is libname.so, rather
# than libname.so.0.0.0. It also suppresses generation of the libname.so.0 and
# libname.so soft links that refer to the binary image
# Because Iâ€™m using both
# options, my module will simply be named hithere.so
